course project for COMP5331

Zhenhua : 
I just uploaded the OModel and IModel (both are in OModel.py) part, you can test it using uploaded test.csv and test2.csv.
Fatal issue: there is no data about availble amount of docks and bikes, which makes it impossible to calculate customer loss. It should be discussed ASAP.
